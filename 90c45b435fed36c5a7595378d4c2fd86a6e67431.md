In `plugins/masto.ts`, a Nuxt.js plugin is exported as default. The puglin uses the `login()` function from the `masto` package to authenticate with a Mastodon server at `https://mas.to`. The resulting `MastoClient` instance is provided to the Vue.js application instance using the `provide()` function. The `masto` key is used to register this instance in the Vue.js app's dependency injection system.
