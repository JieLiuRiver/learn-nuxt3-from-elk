###### `flex`
`flex` is a utility class in unocss that adds `display: flex` to an element, allowing it to be a flex container. Once display: flex has been set, additional classes can be used to define the layout and behavior of child elements.

##### `text-current`
`text-current` is a utility class in unocss, which sets the text color to the current text color of the parent element. It is useful when you want to set the text color to match the parent's color dynamically, without hardcoding a specific color value.

##### `outline-none` 
`outline-none` is a utility class in CSS that removes the outline around an element when it is clicked. This can be useful for styling interactive elements like buttons or links, where the outline that is added by default by the browser can detract from the visual design. It is often paired with other pseudo-class selectors like `:focus` to create a custom focus style for elements.

##### `p="x2 y1"` 
In a words, this shorthand sets a padding of 1 unit on the top and bottom and 2 units on the left and right.

##### `border="~ border"` 
`border="~ border"` means that the border should be removed.

The `border` class typically provides a default border styling for an element, so adding `~` before it negates that styling and removes the border altogether.

`border="t border"` adds a top border to the element with the default border style defined in the Uno CSS theme.

The `t` is a shorthand for the `border-top `property, while `border` is a utility class provided by Uno CSS for the default border style.

`border="l r border"`
